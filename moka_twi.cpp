/* This file manages TWI communication, and dispatch requests from master to slave functions
 * The master can send or request data
 * Data sent is managed by mw_receivedhandler()
 * Data request is managed by mw_requestHandler();
 *
 * A data send will be typically an instruction byte from master,
 * followed by one or more data byte(s) from master to slave
 * A data request will be typically an instruction byte,
 * followed by one or more data byte(s) from slave to master.
 *
 * There are a certain amount of features to be implemented
 * System features:
 * Reset 								Reset
 * Debounce delay 						DebounceDelay + 1 byte
 * Leds ON 								DisplayState | (bool)state
 * Blink 								BlinkState | (bool)state
 * Blinking ON delay 					BlinkOnDelay + 2 bytes
 * Blinking OFF delay 					BlinkOffDelay + 2 bytes
 *
 * Led features:
 * Clear display 						ClrDisplay
 * Set a led color (8 bits)				SetLed8 | LedNumber + 1 byte
 * Set a led color (24 bits)			SetLed24 | LedNumber + 3 bytes
 * Set global color (8 bits)			SetColor8 + 1 byte
 * Set global color (24 bits)			SetColor24 + 3 bytes
 * Get a led color (8 bits)				GetLed8 | LedNumber + 1 byte to master
 * Get a led color (24 bits)			GetLed24 | LedNumber + 3 bytes to master
 * 
 * Button features:
 * Read button 							ReadButton | ButtonNumber + 1 byte to master
 * Read buttons							ReadButtons + 1 byte to master
